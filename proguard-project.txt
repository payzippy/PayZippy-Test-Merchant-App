# To enable ProGuard in your project, edit project.properties
# to define the proguard.config property as described in that file.
#
# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in this file are appended to flags specified
# in ${sdk.dir}/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt
# You can edit the include path and order by changing the ProGuard
# include property in project.properties.
#
# For more details, see
#   http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/proguard.html

# Add any project specific keep options here:

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
   public *;
}
-dontwarn org.apache.commons.codec.**

##---------------Begin: proguard configuration for Gson  ----------
# Gson uses generic type information stored in a class file when working with fields. Proguard
# removes such information by default, so configure it to keep all of it.
-keepattributes Signature

# For using GSON @Expose annotation
-keepattributes *Annotation*

# Gson specific classes
-keep class sun.misc.Unsafe { *; }
#-keep class com.google.gson.stream.** { *; }
-keep class com.google.gson.** {*;}
-keepclassmembers class com.google.gson.** {*;}
#-keepclasseswithmembernames com.google.gson.** {*;}

# Application classes that will be serialized/deserialized over Gson
-keep class com.payzippy.oneclick.data.** { *; }

#Webview javascript interface fix
-keepclassmembers class * {
    @android.webkit.JavascriptInterface <methods>;
}


# Since project uses WebView with JS, we need to add the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
-keep class com.payzippy.oneclick.jssupoort.** { *; }
-keepclassmembers class com.payzippy.oneclick.jssupport.** { *; }
